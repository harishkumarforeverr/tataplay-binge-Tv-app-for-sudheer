00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:09.925
Do you want to tell
anything about your father?

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:16.565
Like his name, his background,
what he does now?

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:22.605
My father's name is..

00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:24.765
Sister, dad is calling.

00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:36.765
Hi dad.
- Hello.

00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:40.765
Let me talk
to Radhika. Hurry up.

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:44.325
Sister is a bit busy now.

00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:45.645
Give her the phone!

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:53.685
Sister, dad wants to
talk to you. Looks like danger.

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:57.245
Talk to him.
- Excuse me.

00:01:00.085 --> 00:01:04.685
Yes, dad.
- Radhika, promise me.

00:01:05.685 --> 00:01:09.085
You will not tell your father's
name or your guru's name.

00:01:12.645 --> 00:01:17.045
Dad.
Why do you say that?

00:01:17.085 --> 00:01:19.605
Don't question me.
Just promise me.

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:23.045
Neither before the camera
nor behind the camera.

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:25.085
Neither on the
stage or off the stage.

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:28.645
You must never
utter my name. Understood?

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:31.965
Will you promise me?
Did you understand?

00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:36.365
Okay. I got you.

00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:39.765
But why do you say so?

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:44.045
I want you to
be seen by everyone.

00:01:44.445 --> 00:01:48.565
'How can I tell you that
my past will spoil your future.'

00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:50.965
'That isn't a support
but a burden.'

00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:56.845
Radhika.. now..

00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:01.365
Listen to me carefully.

00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:07.245
I want Kathak
to be famous.

00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:14.165
People have known me as
Kathak dancer and Kathak guru.

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:18.685
I should just
be known like that.

00:02:20.205 --> 00:02:23.805
My name should not

00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:25.685
supersede Kathak.

00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:30.765
If that happens,
then it will be wrong.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.245
Listen to me.

00:02:34.565 --> 00:02:38.445
I don't want to be on the TV.

00:02:43.645 --> 00:02:45.565
Dad..

00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:48.605
'You will be doing
a contemporary dance'

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:51.805
'from the movie 'Kabir Singh'
for the song 'Bekhayali'.'

00:02:52.725 --> 00:02:54.525
About my dance

00:02:56.685 --> 00:02:58.885
they have asked me to..

00:03:00.445 --> 00:03:03.245
Let me talk.
Give it to us too.

00:03:04.125 --> 00:03:05.085
Hey..
- Please, ma'am.

00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:13.485
I know that you
are carrying a huge burden

00:03:14.645 --> 00:03:16.485
of aspirations, dreams,

00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:19.405
expectations,
and responsibilities.

00:03:19.845 --> 00:03:21.925
I know

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:26.445
that you'll easily
shoulder

00:03:27.725 --> 00:03:28.805
these responsibilities.

00:03:30.885 --> 00:03:35.005
You are the star that
was hidden behind clouds

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:39.765
but this one chance

00:03:40.445 --> 00:03:42.325
has cleared all the clouds.

00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:47.205
Now you will
shine and shine so well

00:03:47.605 --> 00:03:48.925
that everyone
will be spellbound

00:03:50.925 --> 00:03:54.445
because your
foundation is Kathak.

00:03:56.885 --> 00:03:58.845
The strength of our art.

00:04:00.685 --> 00:04:04.965
Remember that in face of
problems,

00:04:05.565 --> 00:04:08.645
strength will help you.

00:04:11.045 --> 00:04:15.285
You didn't tell me

00:04:16.085 --> 00:04:18.245
the dance that you will be
performing.

00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:28.445
Now, what will I tell dad?

00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:32.085
Radhika, are you tense?

00:04:33.285 --> 00:04:34.325
Are you afraid?

00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:39.445
Listen to me.
Don't be afraid.

00:04:40.085 --> 00:04:41.005
I am with you.

00:04:41.925 --> 00:04:46.685
And if you feel
overwhelmed there,

00:04:46.725 --> 00:04:47.925
then come back.

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:50.365
I am here
with you. I..

00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:53.725
Dad, it is a surprise.

00:04:54.005 --> 00:04:56.205
They haven't announced it yet.

00:04:56.325 --> 00:05:00.005
Tara?
- Yes.

00:05:00.885 --> 00:05:03.205
Sister is getting
interviewed so I took the phone

00:05:03.565 --> 00:05:07.045
to talk to you.

00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:11.725
Sister is busy right now
and the people from Dancer No. 1

00:05:11.885 --> 00:05:12.885
have kept it has a surprise
and haven't announced yet.

00:05:12.925 --> 00:05:14.645
Okay.. fine.

00:05:17.325 --> 00:05:21.405
Tara, is Radhika fine?

00:05:21.845 --> 00:05:24.685
Yes, dad.
She is absolutely fine.

00:05:25.485 --> 00:05:26.765
And I am also here.

00:05:27.245 --> 00:05:28.405
What about your studies?

00:05:29.445 --> 00:05:32.085
Studies? That
is going on very well.

00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:36.565
I am studying so much that
I'll be starting to revise soon.

00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:39.805
Very good.
I will talk to you later.

00:05:40.085 --> 00:05:41.925
Bye. See you.

00:05:43.845 --> 00:05:46.165
Okay fine.
- See you.

00:05:53.485 --> 00:05:55.085
What did you do Tara?

00:05:56.765 --> 00:05:59.845
But I had to do something

00:06:00.845 --> 00:06:02.565
for sister, for Kathak.

00:06:03.005 --> 00:06:05.085
If sister does Kathak,
then she will win

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:08.205
and if sister wins,
then dad will be happy.

00:06:10.965 --> 00:06:14.445
But sister
can't do contemporary dance.

00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:22.205
O Lord Ganesh, usually you
grant me boons just for nothing.

00:06:22.725 --> 00:06:24.085
Today, grant me
boons on my request.

00:06:24.645 --> 00:06:27.165
If Ankit tells the truth,

00:06:27.565 --> 00:06:30.685
then it will be our end.

00:06:31.685 --> 00:06:35.005
You saved Mr. Ankit.
That was kind of you.

00:06:35.565 --> 00:06:39.125
but do something
for her too.

00:06:39.485 --> 00:06:42.365
Let sister do Kathak.

00:06:42.725 --> 00:06:45.325
But what about
the western dance?

00:06:47.165 --> 00:06:49.725
Please do something,
Lord Ganesha.

00:06:55.005 --> 00:06:58.645
Hello Sir. We have come
to take you to the grand finale.

00:06:59.365 --> 00:07:01.525
Don't worry.
I talked to the doctor

00:07:01.565 --> 00:07:03.605
and he has given the permission

00:07:04.165 --> 00:07:05.845
Moreover,
RT sir also wants the same.

00:07:06.205 --> 00:07:08.405
You have been with us
for the last 6 seasons

00:07:08.645 --> 00:07:11.005
so how can we
start without you?

00:07:57.445 --> 00:07:58.485
What..

00:08:00.885 --> 00:08:05.045
Where's the Mane family?
Why didn't they come yet?

00:08:06.645 --> 00:08:07.685
'Tara, come in.'

00:08:08.845 --> 00:08:09.805
Who is that?

00:08:09.965 --> 00:08:11.485
'Tara, Parag here. Come in.'

00:08:12.205 --> 00:08:13.245
Oh!

00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:17.165
H-Hello..

00:08:17.325 --> 00:08:19.765
Y-Yes.. Coming..

00:08:20.565 --> 00:08:22.285
But where should I come?

00:08:22.565 --> 00:08:23.525
'Backstage.'

00:08:24.205 --> 00:08:25.525
Y-Yes..

00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:39.325
Do you have the lip balm?
Thank you.

00:08:54.165 --> 00:08:55.605
Mr. Rajesh, I am here.

00:08:55.645 --> 00:08:59.245
Do this. Take these papers
and make their copies.

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:00.605
Keep them on the table
of the judges

00:09:00.685 --> 00:09:02.285
and check if there
are water bottles.

00:09:02.845 --> 00:09:04.925
And all three of them drink
different type of water.

00:09:05.285 --> 00:09:06.565
What?

00:09:07.285 --> 00:09:09.605
Cool, warm and chilled. Okay?

00:09:10.685 --> 00:09:11.605
Okay.

00:09:15.045 --> 00:09:16.485
Have you come to take
a stroll on Worli Sea Face?

00:09:17.445 --> 00:09:19.245
No. But I want to go there.

00:09:20.485 --> 00:09:22.245
Tara, this was a taunt.

00:09:23.845 --> 00:09:25.245
Is it? Why?

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:27.525
The production had given
you the dress.

00:09:27.605 --> 00:09:28.925
Where's the volunteer's t-shirt?

00:09:29.325 --> 00:09:30.405
Oh! That one.

00:09:30.885 --> 00:09:32.365
Aunt washed it.

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:34.165
How could I have come
in a wet t-shirt?

00:09:35.405 --> 00:09:37.405
Yes, it's my mistake.

00:09:37.845 --> 00:09:41.045
I forgot to inform aunt
that there's uniform here.

00:09:41.605 --> 00:09:43.765
But you should give us
an extra t-shirt.

00:09:44.045 --> 00:09:46.685
Stop it.. I don't have time
to listen to your nonsense.

00:09:46.725 --> 00:09:48.645
And where's your badge?

00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:51.205
I don't have it. - What?

00:09:51.885 --> 00:09:53.525
Stay here. - I am busy.

00:09:54.085 --> 00:09:55.045
Tara, stop.

00:10:05.085 --> 00:10:06.045
Excuse me, everyone.

00:10:07.245 --> 00:10:08.605
Please dip your shoes in this

00:10:09.045 --> 00:10:11.005
before you go on the stage.

00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:13.005
This is cola.

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:16.725
So that you don't slip
on the stage. Okay?

00:10:17.165 --> 00:10:18.885
Okay, ma'am.
- Okay, thank you.

00:10:23.645 --> 00:10:26.565
'Tara.. All Aces..'

00:10:27.205 --> 00:10:28.125
It's 'all access'.

00:10:29.005 --> 00:10:29.965
What does it mean?

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.885
You can go anywhere
on the set

00:10:31.925 --> 00:10:33.245
without any restriction.
Understood?

00:10:39.845 --> 00:10:42.245
Does that mean
I can go anywhere?

00:10:42.805 --> 00:10:43.725
Yes.

00:10:58.085 --> 00:10:59.445
Do you have the phone numbers

00:10:59.485 --> 00:11:00.685
of all the participants
and judges?

00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:04.085
No.

00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:05.605
You must have them.
- Then give them to me.

00:11:09.365 --> 00:11:11.325
Here are the numbers of
all the participants and judges.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:22.725
'From Tara, to Satara,
she is my biggest fan.'

00:11:23.085 --> 00:11:24.325
'Bigger than anyone.'

00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:26.005
'Wow! I like it!;

00:11:26.605 --> 00:11:29.965
Dream girl. We don't have time.
Make it fast. - Okay.

00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:36.605
I will save MK's number.

00:11:37.045 --> 00:11:39.165
Where's Sister Radhika?
I need her phone.

00:11:59.125 --> 00:12:00.685
I am actually beautiful.

00:12:01.645 --> 00:12:03.285
Had I realised this before

00:12:04.045 --> 00:12:05.965
I would've been
so famous in Lucknow.

00:12:07.365 --> 00:12:10.485
And look at this mirror!
It's so big!

00:12:12.605 --> 00:12:15.925
I must win
'Dancer Number One' now.

00:12:16.805 --> 00:12:18.165
Whatever it takes.

00:12:19.365 --> 00:12:20.965
By hook

00:12:21.565 --> 00:12:22.685
or crook.

00:12:23.645 --> 00:12:25.645
But I will make sure I win
'Dancer Number One'.

00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:28.045
And then, I will set up a
bigger mirror than this

00:12:28.085 --> 00:12:29.685
in Lucknow.

00:12:51.885 --> 00:12:53.965
This is Radhika's phone.

00:12:54.085 --> 00:12:55.525
And I am her sister.

00:12:55.805 --> 00:12:56.805
Oh!

00:12:58.165 --> 00:12:59.085
Did you see this?

00:12:59.125 --> 00:13:03.085
'Tara Mane. All access
production assistant.'

00:13:03.805 --> 00:13:04.725
Oh, wow!

00:13:05.965 --> 00:13:08.245
Where is sister?
Did you see her?

00:13:09.845 --> 00:13:11.525
No, I didn't.

00:13:12.205 --> 00:13:14.365
But she was upset
after seeing her customer

00:13:14.405 --> 00:13:15.285
of western dance.

00:13:15.885 --> 00:13:20.445
I tried to console her.
But you know your sister.

00:13:25.125 --> 00:13:27.245
Sister is so worried about

00:13:27.285 --> 00:13:30.005
this Bollywood
and western mix dance.

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:32.485
She can't perform
anything other than 'Kathak'.

00:13:33.085 --> 00:13:34.445
And how will she even do it?

00:13:35.325 --> 00:13:37.565
'You have responsibility.'

00:13:37.645 --> 00:13:41.085
'You can fulfil it only
if you work hard.'

00:13:41.565 --> 00:13:43.325
In this grand opening episode

00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:46.325
they want me to perform
the western dance.

00:13:47.205 --> 00:13:49.805
'Dear, you are that star
who was hiding'

00:13:49.845 --> 00:13:51.445
'behind the clouds so far.'

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:56.405
'Now, this one chance
has pushed all the clouds.'

00:13:56.565 --> 00:13:58.485
'And then,
you will shine so much'

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:00.205
'that it will leave
everyone in splits.'

00:14:01.605 --> 00:14:04.085
Now I must do something.

00:14:05.085 --> 00:14:07.485
I have also got access
to everywhere now.

00:14:08.245 --> 00:14:09.725
Now this is my responsibility.

00:14:18.605 --> 00:14:20.445
The light is tense.
Check the converges.

00:14:20.725 --> 00:14:22.205
And the camera
won't be static.

00:14:24.245 --> 00:14:25.245
Sir.

00:14:25.325 --> 00:14:25.885
Yes?

00:14:25.925 --> 00:14:30.685
I had a special request.

00:14:30.965 --> 00:14:31.885
Tell me.

00:14:34.045 --> 00:14:35.925
I have a kind request.

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:37.245
Shoot. - What?

00:14:37.405 --> 00:14:38.445
Tell me.

00:14:38.645 --> 00:14:41.365
This performance..

00:14:41.405 --> 00:14:44.325
Vimal, repeat please.
- I am telling you.

00:14:44.405 --> 00:14:46.845
Don't disturb me.
Go, talk to your senior.

00:14:48.365 --> 00:14:50.445
Yes, I am coming. - Sir..

00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:54.045
'Production assistant..'

00:14:57.445 --> 00:14:58.405
Yes..

00:14:58.965 --> 00:15:00.525
All access, Tara..

00:15:01.125 --> 00:15:03.245
'Where are you?
Rush to the makeup room.'

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:04.405
'Go to the room number ten.'

00:15:04.725 --> 00:15:06.245
Yes. I am going.

00:15:13.325 --> 00:15:14.605
Hello.

00:15:15.085 --> 00:15:17.485
Greetings? - You
are from production, right?

00:15:18.765 --> 00:15:20.125
How do you know?

00:15:23.885 --> 00:15:25.365
You saw it from there?

00:15:25.485 --> 00:15:26.965
You read it?

00:15:27.045 --> 00:15:28.725
Yes, clear.

00:15:29.245 --> 00:15:30.485
Tell me.

00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:33.765
Will you do
something for me?

00:15:33.925 --> 00:15:35.845
I was born for
great things. Tell me.

00:15:36.125 --> 00:15:38.485
My mother is here
in the audience.

00:15:38.645 --> 00:15:41.085
Can you make her sit
in a nice spot?

00:15:41.645 --> 00:15:45.125
And a place where she can
see my act well.

00:15:45.805 --> 00:15:47.965
I am a bit busy
right now

00:15:48.525 --> 00:15:51.325
but if it is your mom
then I will do it.

00:15:51.445 --> 00:15:52.725
Mothers are lovely.

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.165
Thank you.

00:15:55.125 --> 00:15:57.285
Saira, why are you
not practicing?

00:15:59.165 --> 00:16:00.405
I am.

00:16:00.605 --> 00:16:03.365
Kathak is a new style
for you

00:16:03.445 --> 00:16:05.125
and yet you shy away
from practice.

00:16:05.365 --> 00:16:06.765
Please do not take it
lightly.

00:16:07.005 --> 00:16:09.165
I am sorry.
I am on it.

00:16:09.325 --> 00:16:10.565
Yes.

00:16:14.805 --> 00:16:16.285
Anyone in Room 10?

00:16:17.605 --> 00:16:20.085
I had to go in Room no. 10
for makeup.

00:16:20.685 --> 00:16:22.605
I was on my way there
and I got lost.

00:16:23.045 --> 00:16:27.485
Dear God! God focus
on me and help me focus.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:33.285
Here.

00:16:33.365 --> 00:16:34.445
Yes, okay.

00:16:41.845 --> 00:16:43.245
Dear God!

00:16:44.685 --> 00:16:47.965
This is greater
than the palace of Satara.

00:16:48.605 --> 00:16:49.965
It is Mumbai.

00:16:51.925 --> 00:16:55.205
Look here.
Shining lights!

00:16:55.805 --> 00:16:57.325
What is that?

00:16:59.125 --> 00:17:00.525
It is a camera,
grandma.

00:17:00.605 --> 00:17:03.205
Is there something like that?
I never knew.

00:17:04.285 --> 00:17:06.285
Sachin never
brought me here.

00:17:08.005 --> 00:17:09.165
Brother-in-law?

00:17:09.245 --> 00:17:10.525
Why will he bring you here?

00:17:12.685 --> 00:17:14.125
Why will he bring you here?

00:17:17.049 --> 00:17:18.449
He never took me.

00:17:19.209 --> 00:17:23.329
He never took me
to his dance.

00:17:24.249 --> 00:17:27.569
There was a show
in Satara that day.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:29.969
He never took me there.

00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:33.009
Mom, leave it be.
Leave it be.

00:17:33.729 --> 00:17:36.889
We'll be on TV.

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:40.689
That camera will pan
and we all will be seen.

00:17:41.809 --> 00:17:44.209
It is all because of Radhika.

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:47.809
Her hard work, dedication
and her luck.

00:17:48.209 --> 00:17:51.809
It has brought her
and all of us.

00:17:51.889 --> 00:17:56.449
Even Tara has a hand in it.

00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:59.929
Had she not remembered

00:18:00.009 --> 00:18:01.649
we would have seen
all this on TV.

00:18:02.049 --> 00:18:06.369
But Mom..
- Tara is a manager here.

00:18:06.609 --> 00:18:08.569
She must have
arranged all this.

00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:12.609
Mother-in-law, Tara must be
looking after small details.

00:18:12.929 --> 00:18:15.209
The manager must be
someone else.

00:18:15.689 --> 00:18:17.369
She is right.
- Quiet.

00:18:18.249 --> 00:18:21.049
You cannot see
Tara's hard work.

00:18:22.289 --> 00:18:23.809
A dance show that is..

00:18:24.449 --> 00:18:25.649
No.

00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:27.249
A dance show that is..

00:18:28.889 --> 00:18:31.649
We welcome you all
to the seventh season.

00:18:35.809 --> 00:18:37.169
And even yours.

00:18:38.209 --> 00:18:39.409
Please enter.

00:18:44.329 --> 00:18:45.649
Final RO?

00:18:47.049 --> 00:18:48.929
RO?
- R. O.

00:18:49.729 --> 00:18:50.849
What next?

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:53.169
I have been given three
different versions.

00:18:53.409 --> 00:18:54.609
Which one is final?

00:18:55.089 --> 00:18:57.449
I have been asking Parag
but no one told me anything.

00:18:58.769 --> 00:19:00.089
Where is the final RO?

00:19:01.209 --> 00:19:03.569
Get me the final RO,
a.s.a.p.?

00:19:05.449 --> 00:19:08.089
A.s.a.p.? What does that mean?

00:19:08.169 --> 00:19:10.689
One more thing.
The AC is not working.

00:19:11.369 --> 00:19:12.929
Can you see how much
I am sweating?

00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:15.289
I will lose my makeup.

00:19:28.969 --> 00:19:31.849
Do you know
what an RO is?

00:19:34.849 --> 00:19:36.049
So get it.

00:19:37.849 --> 00:19:39.609
Let us do it one by one.

00:19:40.289 --> 00:19:42.769
RO or AC?

00:19:43.769 --> 00:19:45.449
RO!
- Okay.

00:19:45.889 --> 00:19:47.449
Now GO. Go.

00:19:51.129 --> 00:19:53.969
Four days.
She will be gone in four days.

00:19:54.929 --> 00:19:57.369
Get him here.
He is hurt. Careful.

00:20:09.688 --> 00:20:12.888
So what? - Why
are you still standing here?

00:20:13.288 --> 00:20:16.048
Radhika.
Radhika Mane.

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:17.608
Who is she?

00:20:18.088 --> 00:20:20.248
She is about to dance.

00:20:20.328 --> 00:20:22.168
You are the family
of contestant?

00:20:22.328 --> 00:20:23.408
Yes.

00:20:23.488 --> 00:20:24.888
You should have been here
early today.

00:20:24.928 --> 00:20:28.168
We left three hours ago.

00:20:28.488 --> 00:20:30.008
And we
went to the station

00:20:30.088 --> 00:20:34.448
and there
was such a crowd.

00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:36.648
Trains arrived and left.

00:20:36.728 --> 00:20:38.248
We were there.

00:20:38.408 --> 00:20:39.328
Come with me.

00:20:39.368 --> 00:20:41.368
Yes,
- Let's go.

00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:15.048
I am so sorry.

00:21:15.208 --> 00:21:18.448
I will not laugh again.
I promise.

00:21:33.568 --> 00:21:36.328
There is..

00:21:37.728 --> 00:21:42.448
There is a girl here.

00:21:43.448 --> 00:21:47.128
She..

00:21:47.288 --> 00:21:49.488
is young.

00:21:51.008 --> 00:21:55.848
Did you see her?
